# Ants-Sim
Multi player ant simulation game
Created graphical simulation of ant colonies eating and growing, based on user commands, while avoiding dangers in C++ . Users can program their ant colony’s behavior via a text file.
Implemented interpreter that reads the user’s text files and alters ants behavior. Implemented collision detection and an event handler to dictate ant interaction with other objects.
Utilized object oriented design to design complex class inheritance structure for objects in the simulation (ant, grasshopper, etc.)
